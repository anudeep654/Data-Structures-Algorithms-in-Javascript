# Sorting Algorithms

### BubbleSort

### Selection Sort

### InsertionSort

All the above sorting algorithms will have a complexity of O(n^2);

### Merge sort

Will have a complexity with n(O(logn))
This sort will be more usefull when you have huge number in your array.

### QuickSort

will have a complexity with n(O(logn)) in average and best cases but in worst cases it is O(n^2)
This sort also works like merge sort using helper methods.

### Radix Sort
