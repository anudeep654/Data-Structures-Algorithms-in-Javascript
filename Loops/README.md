//we have for loops ,for each ,for in,for of ,do while,while loops

// for loops

//use only if we need to iterate set of arrays

```javascript
for(let i=0;i<10;i++{

}

//for each
arr = [1,2,3,4]

arr.array.forEach(element => {

}); //for each will give  a call back for each element

//for IN
arr = [1,2,3,4]
for(let arr1 in arr){

}

//used to iterate the enumerables in object,iterating over arrays,maps etc; but mainly for objects

//for Of

arr = [1,2,3,4]
for(let arr1 of arr){

}

//for of will be used for iterating the each element in the arrays,maps etc;


//While loop
while(condition)
//executing only if there is a condition

//do while loop

do{

}
while(condition){

}

//it works by doing the do loop at once before the while loop is executed.Do will work even the while loop condition is failed.

```
